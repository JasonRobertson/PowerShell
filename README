Hello There, 

If you are reading this you have taken an interest in my PowerShell-Scripts repository. I thank you for take the time to read this README file. As noted in the short description the scripts here are free to use and provided as-is with no warranty. I highly RECOMMEND that you read and understand the scope of each script prior to running any environment. The scripts are designed to be non-desctructive and not change any settings within an environment. 

Remember NEVER Trust and ALWAYS verify!
